## Simple Reaction Times of Ipsilateral and Contralateral Hand to Lateralized Visual Stimuli 
**Experimental design and idea taken from Berlucchi et al. - 1971 - SIMPLE REACTION TIMES OF IPSILATERAL AND CONTRALATERAL**


**Description:**

Experimental test analyzing the neural circuits underlying a simple visuomotor task, by measuring the reaction time of each hand when restricted visual stimuli were presented on one side of the fixation point or the other  

**Results of paper:** 

Visual stimuli presented on one side of the fixation point elicit faster reactions from the ipsilateral than from the contralateral hand 
The delay of the cross and uncrossed responses remains constant regardless of the degree of eccentricity of the visual stimuli, it is concluded that the inter hemispheric integration of simple visuomotor tasks in not crucially dependent upon the callosal connections in the visual cortex 

## Method

* **Participant instruction:**  Position of the head held constant, fixated on small patch 
* Fixation cross in centre
* Translucent hemispheric dome, 1 m in diameter
* **Conditions:** Distance between right eye and any point on the hemisphere 30cm (left eye occluded with special mask)
* (Hemispheric screen was diffusely illuminated by an overhead light source whoâ€™s intensity, measured at the screen was 20 lux ) - this is ignored for the sake of this project


**Stimulus :** a square patch of light one square degree in area, flashed on different points of the screen from the rear  

* This project displays a circle stimuli 

**Duration of flash**: 32 MSEC


**Duration of the fore-period:**  Randomly varied with a range of 2 to 3 sec

## Response expectations

The participant must response ASAP by pressing his fore finger one of two switches beside him:
The right hand switch 
The left hand switch 
(Depending on particular experimental condition)
Reaction times recorded to the nearest millisecond 


## Experimental sessions : in paper 3 experimental sessions, intersession period a week:
** This project will code for one session as follows:**
**In each session:** 
* The stimulus pattern is presented in succession to six retinal points, all lying on the horizontal meridian: 

	* 5 degrees, 20 degrees, 35 degrees nasal (towards your nose)

	* 5 degrees , 20 degrees and 35 degrees temporal (towards your ear)

	* A session is divided into 3 parts :

## There are four blocks with 9 trials per block. 

 ## Temporal
   * LHS and Temporal
   * RHS and Temporal
   * RHS and Temporal
   * LHS and Temporal

## Nasal

   * LHS and Nasal
   * RHS and Nasal
   * RHS and Nasal
   * LHS and Nasal
4 blocks of 9 trials were run with the stimulus on one side of the fixation point and then another four blocks were run with the stimulus at the same visual angle on the other side (5 degrees temporal, 5 degrees nasal )



**Number of Trials** 

Any given session involved 360 (216) trials altogether, consisting of 72 trials with each of the six retinal points tested. 
Half of these trials were with the right hand,
Half with the left hand 

Before these experimental trials there were another five practice trials with both hands with the stimulus in each position. 


## Additional method points



* Anticipatory responses: any reaction time less than 180, 190, 200 sec, for the retinal positions of 5,20, 35 degrees respectively, 

* Delayed response : the limits of delay of the response for the same stimulus positions were 320, 250, 280 sec. 


Within each session, the average reaction time for each hand for each position of the stimulus pattern was obtained by finding the median of each consecutive run of 5 reaction times then by computing the mean of the six medians 


## Groups of Reaction Times 

Four groups of reaction time measures were thus obtained for any given position of the visual stimulus :
**Uncrossed reactions**
right hand and right field & left hand and left field 
**Crossed reactions**
Right hand and left field, left hand and right field 

An analysis of variance was carried out to find the influence of four variables, stimulus position, side of stimulation, hand and the practice effect. The data from the two groups of subjects were analyzed separately, so as to assess the possible effects of previous practice and or knowledge of the problem
